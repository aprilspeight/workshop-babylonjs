# Scenario

The HBCU Legacy Bowl, presented by the [Black College Football Hall of Fame](https://www.blackcollegefootballhof.org), is a postseason all-star game showcasing the best NFL draft-eligible football players from Historically Black Colleges and Universities. For this workshop, we'll honor all athletes in a virtual Hall of Fame created for the web & virtual reality (VR).

You'll create your own personal exhibit for the Hall of Fame using Babylon.js and WebXR. Your exhibit will include the following:

- Exhibit objects
- A photo of yourself
- An animated character
