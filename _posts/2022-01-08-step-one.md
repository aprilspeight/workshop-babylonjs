## Create a Scene

Whether you are creating a whole world or just placing one model into a web page you need a scene to contain the world or model, a camera to view it, a light to illuminate it, and at least one viewable object as a model.

For this workshop, we'll use the Babylon.js playground: <a href="https://playground.babylonjs.com">https://playground.babylonjs.com</a>

The Playground consists of four areas:

<ul>
<li>Menu bar (top)</li>
<li>Links bar (bottom)</li>
<li>Coding editor (left)</li>
<li>Rendering area (right)</li>
</ul>

The space for the coding editor and rendering area can be adjusted by dragging the vertical bar between them.

## Instructions

1. Navigate to <a href="https://playground.babylonjs.com">https://playground.babylonjs.com</a>.
